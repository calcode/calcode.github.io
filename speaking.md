I have been delighted to speak at events and conferences, with a personal focus on digital strategy, marketing and culture. 

Recently I have looked to share learnings from helping the public sector adopt user centric methods and begin to think differently about digital. I have spoken to small and medium sized businesses for both [DigitasLBi](http://www.digitaslbi.com/uk/) and [VisitScotland](http://www.visitscotland.com/) in the past.

- [We are moving the cheese](https://speakerdeck.com/calumshepherd/we-are-moving-the-cheese). What we learned building something from nothing through empowerment and agile methods
- [Putting users at the heart of your digital strategy](https://speakerdeck.com/calumshepherd/putting-users-at-the-heart-of-your-digital-strategy)
- [Be digital, your customers are](https://speakerdeck.com/calumshepherd/be-digital-your-customers-are)
