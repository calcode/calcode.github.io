If you think there is value I could add at your event, give me a shout - always happy to talk with other people in the industry!

I have spoken at quite a few events over the years, with the most notable events being [Lean Agile Scotland (2015)](http://leanagile.scot/) and [Lean Agile Glasgow (2019)](https://www.meetup.com/Lean-Agile-Glasgow/).

> [We are moving the cheese](https://speakerdeck.com/calumshepherd/we-are-moving-the-cheese). What we learned building something from nothing through empowerment and agile methods - Holyrood Connect Conference, 2015.
