I have been delighted to speak at events and conferences focused on digital strategy, marketing and culture. 

Most recently I have looked to share learnings from creating a central point of access for public services, based upon agile and responsive principles. 

I have also talked with small businesses on improving their website visibility for [VisitScotland](http://www.visitscotland.com/), and at ’What’s Next in Digital Transformation' for [DigitasLBi](http://www.digitaslbi.com/uk/). 

Slides are normally available through [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/calumshepherd).
