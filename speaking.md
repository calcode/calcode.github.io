I'm super happy to attend events in the product management space, either as an attendee or a speaker.

I'm most interested in discovery and prioritisation techniques at the moment.

> I have spoken at quite a few events over the years, including [EuroGeographics in Prague (2018)](https://eurogeographics.org/), [Lean Agile Scotland (2015)](http://leanagile.scot/) and [LeanAgile Glasgow (2019)](https://www.meetup.com/Lean-Agile-Glasgow/).

You can get in touch with me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calumshepherd) and [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/calumshepherd).
