I have been delighted to attend and speak at a number of events in the past. 

Previous talks have included small business in the Scottish Borders for [VisitScotland](http://www.visitscotland.com/) and Whatâ€™s Next in Digital Transformation for [DigitasLBi](http://www.digitaslbi.com/uk/).

These have mainly focused on digital strategy, change and marketing. 

Slide decks are usually made available via [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/calcode).
