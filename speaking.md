I enjoy speaking at product management and agile events. I'm most interested in discovery and prioritisation techniques right now, and getting these right day to day.

Recent talks include;

- [LeanAgile Glasgow (2019)](https://www.meetup.com/Lean-Agile-Glasgow/)
- [EuroGeographics in Prague (2018)](https://eurogeographics.org/)
- [Lean Agile Scotland (2015)](http://leanagile.scot/)
