I’m passionate about speaking at product management events, with a particular focus on discovery and prioritisation techniques. I’m always looking to improve how I can get these right on a day-to-day basis.

Some of my speaking engagements include...

- [LeanAgile Glasgow (2019)](https://www.meetup.com/Lean-Agile-Glasgow/)
- [EuroGeographics in Prague (2018)](https://eurogeographics.org/)
- [Lean Agile Scotland (2015)](http://leanagile.scot/)
