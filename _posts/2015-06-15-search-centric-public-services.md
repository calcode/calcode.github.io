People have been looking to search engines to answers their questions for the best part of ten years now. Searching is now baked into our DNA. Got a question? Google it.  

We know that the majority of people who visit public sector websites come from search engines. Think of them as the modern homepage of the web, where once AOL dominated search engines now rein. 

There is huge demand and information from the public sector is helping to answer a portion of 40,000 searches a second, worldwide. These searches also provide insights that can help us create better products and services for people. 

You can read more on how Google provides it’s results through their [“how search works” guide](http://www.google.co.uk/search/about/insidesearch/howsearchworks/thestory/).

Search is changing however and so should we.

**Moving toward conversational interactions**
Conversational search, or natural language search, is a series of features made available within UK search engines from 2013.

Conversational search allows for an interaction similar to conversation with a friend, through [an ability to comprehend natural language](http://searchengineland.com/google-upgrades-conversational-search-mobile-apps-205535).

- Unnatural, ill-formed search queries are common on desktop. Think searches like “David Cameron age” and “age David Cameron”

- As mobile grows, so do natural, well formed queries such as “What is David Cameron’s age?” and “How old is David Cameron?” 

Conversational search is connecting search queries together as well. You don’t have to think about how you fit everything into one search, you can refine results over multiple searches. 

> “Who is the prime minister?”
> *Response* “David Cameron”

> “How old is he?”
> *Response* “48 years (October 9, 1966)”

You don’t have to provide the name twice, as it was contained within your first search and you referenced him within the second. 

This is made possible through both data from knowledge bases like [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) or [Google Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph)), and from indexed information from websites ([e.g. GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/people/david-cameron)). 

Conversational search and knowledge graph powered results are making waves with information about famous people, in addition to verticals like retail. 

> Answers are returned within the search results, so it has real potential to shake up how information is presented - a real shift towards search centric, informational experiences for public services

**I want to apply for a basic disclosure**
Basic disclosure is a transactional service provided by Disclosure Scotland. Information about the service and the ability to apply is available online. 

Using this example, we can map out what things might look like in the future. 

> “OK Google”
> *(launches Android search box)*  

> “What is a basic disclosure?”
> *Response* “A basic disclosure is a document containing information about you that can be used by employers to make safer recruitment decisions”

> “How much does it cost?” 
> *Response* “A basic disclosure costs £25”

> “Can I use a credit card to pay”
> *Response* “You can pay for a basic disclosure using a credit or debit card”

> “How do I apply?”
> *Response* “You can apply for a basic disclosure online or by post” *(link to apply online)*

We already hold data about our public services through the [Scottish Services list](http://standards.esd.org.uk/?uri=list%2FscottishServices&tab=details) and the Scottish Government services review. 

With both [Freebase](https://www.freebase.com/) and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) offering the ability to input data about public services, there is potential to adopt a common vocabulary and link all this up, going some way to realising our example.

**TL;DR**
We should accept that we won’t always control the experience for users. The future will likely be search centric, informational experiences for public services. 

We now have an opportunity to provide the data and information needed to support such innovation. An opportunity that supports a number of Scottish Government strategies, including the new [Government Economic Strategy for 2015](http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0047/00472389.pdf).
