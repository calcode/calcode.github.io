title: Five highlights from chatting about culture and collaboration at Responsiveorg London

I wrote recently about [ResponsiveOrg](http://blog.calumshep.com/better-collaboration-responsive-org/), it’s [purpose](http://www.responsive.org/aboutus/) and the [manifesto](http://www.responsive.org/manifesto/) that underpins  the whole movement. 

> The idea is that something isn’t quite right about the operating system of our organisations. There is a real opportunity to move towards clearer purpose and better collaboration. 

I decided to pop along to learn more and chat with the community at Responsiveorg London. So, here are my five highlights!

## 1 - The justification for change is clear (and visually appealing!) 
As [Matthew Partovi](https://twitter.com/matthewpartovi) welcomed everyone, attendees were lucky enough to have sketch notes on tap visualising why this movement matters.

## 2 - Focus your efforts on the yellow dots
Engaging people who show no interest in discussing change can be tough. A controversial suggestion is to focus on the people who can be influenced, not the people who can’t. 

- Green dots are people in your network who are energised and engaged
- Yellow dots are influenable
- Red dots are blockers

If you focus your time and effort on people who are considered to be the yellow dots in your network - the hope is that they engage with red dots further down the line. 

## 3 - Transparency can be transformational
During the event there was a share by [@karlwilding](https://twitter.com/karlwilding), from NCVO, about the opportunity for [openness and transparency into board meetings](http://blog.glasspockets.org/2015/04/wilding_pollock-23042015.html). 

There is a great quote tucked away in there:

> “transparency can be transformational”

## 4 - Encourage people to get together
I loved the idea of the instant camera photos and the opportunity for people to tell others their interests. It’s great for finding people who want to talk about similar things.

## 5 - Don't forgot individuals
Spoilt for choice during the workshops, I opted for a more individual focused session titled “Responsive You”. 

The workshop was based upon Very Clear Ideas by Charles Davies and involved asking a series of questions that would help you begin to explore your purpose in life. 

I soon realised my responses were work centric, so when Tom proposed the final question as being our own to ask - I focused on this. 

It provided an opportunity for people to think about their purpose, isolated from the opinion of others. 

** There is another write up that would be worth reading “[Why we need the responsiveorg movement by Silvia Cambie](http://www.silviacambie.com/why-we-need-the-responsiveorg-movement/)”.
