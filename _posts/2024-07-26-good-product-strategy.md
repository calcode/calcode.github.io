Every product needs a good product strategy.

Some companies have one, many *think* they have one, and others knowingly trudge on without one.

What is strategy, why is it important, and what makes a good strategy?

Read on to find out.

### What makes a bad strategy

Let’s start by identifying what makes a bad strategy.
Some of these might hit close to home for some of you.

- It isn’t **fluff**. This is super common. Some might tell you that strategies ‘aren’t supposed to be actionable’. They’ll paint a vague picture for you, leaving you unable to do anything with them. That’s nonsense. If it isn’t actionable, it isn’t a strategy
- It isn’t **financial metrics**. Simply telling your teams to increase revenue isn’t a strategy; it’s a method to measure success. Don’t be surprised or get annoyed when your team look at you blankly after you deliver a strategy like this
- It isn’t **how your teams collaborate**. Explaining how your teams will work together isn’t a strategy; that’s a team topology. Team topologies define the purpose and relationship of teams. They are important, no doubt, but they aren’t strategy

If you are into team topologies, then you can read a great post on team topologies by [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TeamTopologies.html). This is recommended reading.

### What is a strategy?
> “a detailed plan for achieving success in situations such as war, politics, business, industry, or sport, or the skill of planning for such situations” - [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/strategy)

The key phrase here is ‘detailed plan’. It’s amazing how far we’ve strayed from viewing a strategy as a detailed plan.

It takes good old-fashioned hard work to get to this.

### Why is it so important?
Your product strategy is what drives alignment and coordination across your company. It ensures everyone is pulling in the same direction at the same point in time. It’s about creating focus.

Imagine shipping a series of new features for a specific segment over the month and your marketing campaigns all being ready to go, customer success talking about them with confidence, support being ready to answer questions, and sales pitching to these new segments.

Seamless!  

### What makes a good strategy?
The bible on this for me isn’t from a product management source, surprisingly. It’s [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Good-Strategy-Bad-difference-matters/dp/1781256179/ref=asc_df_1781256179/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=697308647252&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13959286353907761805&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9046885&hvtargid=pla-566591824724&psc=1&mcid=5e5268e4d1bc3ecb8573ccddbfcd0784&th=1&psc=1&gad_source=1). You can pick it up on Amazon for cheap as chips.

There’s also an excellent [Marty Cagan piece on product strategy](https://www.svpg.com/product-strategy-overview/). This is product management focused, and it’s excellent.

So, what makes a good strategy?
- It identifies a series of problems or opportunities
- Written in the order you’ll tackle them
- Each has a diagnosis breaking things down a little
- Each has a series of actions for the team(s) to enact

Additionally, a good strategy should also:
- Be in plain English
- Have a ‘curator’, or ‘owner’
- Be updated when new insights come to light
- Be re-communicated when changed
- Be an iterative document
- Be explainable by everyone across the company
- Move you towards your product vision

Stick to this and I suspect you’ll notice less of the team telling you about a ‘lack of focus’ or ‘poor collaboration’.

Let me know how you get on.
