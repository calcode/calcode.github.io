I was lucky enough to attend the [Turing Festival](http://turingfestival.com/) in Edinburgh on the 24th and 25th August 2013. Turing took place over a 2 day period towards the tail of the [Edinburgh Festival](http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/), meaning the city was still in top form. The talks were diverse and interesting, with many speakers using technology as a foundation, as opposed to being the subject itself. This made the festival feel more dynamic, interesting and engaging than your run of the mill event.

##Talks Attended @ Turing Festival 2013

- Five Startups go mad in Edinburgh
- Future of Money
- Digital Distribution

- Digital Marketing &amp; Growth Hacking
- Festival Keynote by Neil Stephenson
- Future of Music

##Future of Money Highlights;

- [Sandra Alzetta](http://www.iabuk.net/people/sandra-alzetta) from Visa gave a extremely grounded speech. She placed a large focus on mobile payments on smartphones, alongside contactless plastic cards. She was keen to highlight the future is both mobile AND plastic, with each having a place in the Visa vision of the future of payments.
- [Mike Hearn](http://plan99.net/~mike/#top) from Bitcoin (and Google)'s speech had to be one of the highlights of the festival. Mike's talk was extremely wide ranging, featuring Google driverless cars and explaining a potential bleak outlook for anyone who doesn't work in the creative sector. He presented a vision for the future focused on a TradeNet and it's autonomous agents - all removing the need for human involvement in more manual, repetitive tasks. A future where machines will run their own businesses, competing in a marketplace against each other for human business. A fascinating insight! He also mentioned some background and ideology on Bitcoin, but this was really overshadowed by everything that preceded it.

> Social reviews don't make that much sense, says Mike Hearn of Google. Lots of spam and strangers #turingfest — [Andrew Girdwood (@AndrewGirdwood)](https://twitter.com/AndrewGirdwood/statuses/370910677512486912) - August 23, 2013

> The future of money by Visa Europe. Trust. Completely agree. Money doesn't do public betas #turingfest @NJones — [Calum Shepherd (@calumshepherd)](https://twitter.com/calumshepherd/statuses/370908903141543936) - August 23, 2013

> Visa Europe forecast 50% of their transactions by 2020 will be mobile #turingfest — [Calum Shepherd (@calumshepherd)](https://twitter.com/calumshepherd/statuses/370903909248028672) - August 23, 2013

##Digital Distribution Highlights;
- The highlight of the digital distribution talks had to be [DJ Powers from Valve](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dj-powers/67/70/495). He gave insight into the Steam eco-system and their recent developments in community contribution. [Team Fortress 2](http://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2) is one of their most recent success stories, seeing a marketplace built out around digital products and official community updates - launched for the entire player base. A success story included a hat seller (for in-game characters) who achieved 6 digit profits for his creations.

> Team Fortress Community Update biggest grossing hour for them after launch. Awesome #turingfest — [Calum Shepherd (@calumshepherd)](https://twitter.com/calumshepherd/statuses/370945261469986816) - August 23, 2013

##Digital marketing and growth hacking

- [Brian Doll from GitHub](http://emphaticsolutions.com/) was first up, reinforcing the need for great marketing to follow a simple philosophy:
> "Build Something, Tell People"

This was an interesting concept that caused split opinion in regards to how easy this is to implement in a large scale organisation. None the less, an ideal that everyone should aspire to. Plus, he had a great animated GIF used across both his presentations!
- [Andrew Girdwood](http://blog.arhg.net/), a former colleague from my time agency side, was presenting his thoughts on the future of digital. A compelling presentation covering native content, examples on how companies are now founded around video seeding / testing and mobile real time bidding.
- [JP Rangaswami](http://confusedofcalcutta.com/about-me/) from Salesforce was quite inspiring. I didn't manage to take any notes from the talk, but came away throughly impressed with his ability to tell stories and bring the audience with him on a journey through technology.

> "Living infographics". Steven Drost from Stipso explains how text can become more than a sum of its parts #turingfest — [Calum Shepherd (@calumshepherd)](https://twitter.com/calumshepherd/statuses/371204304608456704) - August 24, 2013

> Focus on tribes. Focus on communities that already exist's Brian Doll from @github - [Calum Shepherd (@calumshepherd)](https://twitter.com/calumshepherd/statuses/371198273882980352) - August 24, 2013
