I was lucky enough to attend the <a href="http://turingfestival.com/">Turing Festival</a> in Edinburgh on the 24th and 25th August 2013. Turing took place over a 2 day period towards the tail of the <a href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/">Edinburgh Festival</a>, meaning the city was still in top form. The talks were diverse and interesting, with many speakers using technology as a foundation, as opposed to being the subject itself. This made the festival feel more dynamic, interesting and engaging than your run of the mill event.

<strong>Future of Money Highlights;</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.iabuk.net/people/sandra-alzetta"><strong>Sandra Alzetta</strong></a> from Visa gave a extremely grounded speech. She placed a large focus on mobile payments on smartphones, alongside contactless plastic cards. She was keen to highlight the future is both mobile AND plastic, with each having a place in the Visa vision of the future of payments.</li>
	<li><a href="http://plan99.net/~mike/#top"><strong>Mike Hearn</strong></a> from Bitcoin (and Google)'s speech had to be one of the highlights of the festival. Mike's talk was extremely wide ranging, featuring Google driverless cars and explaining a potential bleak outlook for anyone who doesn't work in the creative sector. He presented a vision for the future focused on a TradeNet and it's autonomous agents - all removing the need for human involvement in more manual, repetitive tasks. A future where machines will run their own businesses, competing in a marketplace against each other for human business. A fascinating insight! He also mentioned some background and ideology on Bitcoin, but this was really overshadowed by everything that preceded it.</li>

<ul>
	<li>The highlight of the digital distribution talks had to be <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dj-powers/67/70/495"><strong>DJ Powers from Valve</strong></a>. He gave insight into the eco-system of Steam and their recent developments in community contribution. <a href="http://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2 </a>is one of their most recent success stories, seeing a marketplace built out around digital products and official community updates - launched for the entire player base. A success story included a hat seller (for in-game characters) who achieved 6 digit profits for his creations.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Team Fortress Community Update biggest grossing hour for them after launch. Awesome. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23turingfest&amp;src=hash">#turingfest</a>

<strong>Digital Marketing &amp; Growth Hacking</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://emphaticsolutions.com/"><strong>Brian Doll from Github</strong></a> was first up, reinforcing the need for great marketing to follow a simple philosophy <strong>"Build Something, Tell People"</strong>. An interesting concept that caused split opinion in regards to how easy this is to implement in a large scale organisation. None the less, an ideal that everyone should aspire to. Plus, he had a great animated GIF used across both his presentations!</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.arhg.net/"><strong>Andrew Girdwood</strong></a>, a former colleague from my time agency side, was presenting his thoughts on the future of digital. A compelling presentation covering native content, examples on how companies are now founded around video seeding / testing and mobile real time bidding.</li>
	<li><a href="http://confusedofcalcutta.com/about-me/"><strong>JP Rangaswami</strong></a> from Salesforce was quite inspiring. I didn't manage to take any notes from the talk, but came away throughly impressed with his ability to tell stories and bring the audience with him on a journey through technology.</li>
