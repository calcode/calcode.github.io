I recently came across these adages while browsing the web, and they resonated with me instantly—not just because one of them is from my favorite movie of all time!  

- **Murphy’s Law**  
- **Gilbert’s Law**  
- **Kidlin’s Law**  
- **Wilson’s Law**  
- **Falkland’s Law**  

Let’s explore each one and how you can apply them in your role as a Product Manager.


### Murphy’s Law

> “Anything that can go wrong will go wrong.”  
> “In some formulations, it is extended to: ‘Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and at the worst possible time.’”

This may sound gloomy, but I’ve found it to be a helpful mindset—especially after first hearing it in *Interstellar*.

#### How to Apply It
- **Expect Challenges:** Working in software means recognizing that not everything is within your control. While you can manage certain aspects, you often depend on others (e.g., usable designs, reliable code) to ensure success.  
- **Plan for Edge Cases:** Invest time in planning. Consider potential issues by discussing designs and implementations with engineers, always keeping the customer perspective in mind.  
- **Stay Positive:** When things go wrong (and they will), approach problems with energy and positivity. Engage the right people to address the issue. View setbacks as opportunities to learn rather than as failures.


### Gilbert’s Law

> “The biggest problem with any task or job is that no one tells you what and how to do it.”

Fun fact: Gilbert also happens to be my father-in-law’s name!

#### How to Apply It
- **Be Organized:** As a Product Manager, it’s your job to bring structure to ambiguity. Before diving into new work, take a moment to map out what’s needed to move from problem to solution.  
- **Communicate Clearly:** Whether you’re using formal product development principles or a simple checklist, create a plan and share it with the right stakeholders. The plan can take as little as five minutes to draft, but its impact will be significant.


### Kidlin’s Law

> “If you write the problem down clearly, then the matter is half solved.”

I’m not sure where this adage originates, but it’s one of my favorites.

#### How to Apply It
- **Define the Problem:** Writing a clear, succinct problem statement is one of the hardest—and most crucial—tasks in product development. A well-defined problem helps prevent teams from jumping to solutions prematurely.  
- **Validate Understanding:** Replay the problem statement to your colleagues and customers. Is it specific? Is this the exact issue you want to solve?  
- **Iterate Confidently:** Once you’ve nailed the problem, you can start exploring solutions. Expect to discover new insights along the way—that’s part of the process.


### Wilson’s Law

> “Wealth is not an immediate goal but a byproduct of prioritizing knowledge and intelligence.”

This might sound counterintuitive at first, but there’s more to it than meets the eye.

#### How to Apply It
- **Focus on Growth:** Your value as a Product Manager increases with experience. Take on challenges that push you outside your comfort zone, and you’ll open doors to new opportunities.  
- **Redefine Wealth:** Wealth isn’t just about money. Roles that emphasize the product and people can be deeply rewarding. Also, don’t forget to prioritize what truly matters—like family and personal time.


### Falkland’s Law

> “Think about the things that are absolutely necessary.”

This adage is a game-changer for prioritization.

#### How to Apply It
- **Stay Focused:** Once you’ve identified a specific problem, resist the temptation to tackle unrelated issues. Stay disciplined and solve the problem you set out to address.
