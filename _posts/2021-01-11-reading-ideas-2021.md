I tend to write up notes from books, or just highlight them as I go. I read when I can, but make no conscious effort to read regularly. It’s worked for me in the past, but when things get busy the learning suffers.  

So, this year I’m going to have a commitment to read a book a month every month. It doesn’t seem like much, but it should get me into a good cadence again to help me think differently and continue to learn new things.

## What’s on the list?

- [Michael J Fox - No Time Like the Future](https://www.waterstones.com/book/no-time-like-the-future/michael-j-fox/9781472278463). I’ve read his other books and his optimism has always shown through. However, after a couple of setbacks, how does he view things now? Emotive, and always an excellent read.

- [Mapping Experiences: A Complete Guide to Creating Value through Journeys, Blueprints, and Diagrams](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mapping-Experiences-Complete-Creating-Blueprints-ebook/dp/B01F9Y6B9K). I’ll be honest, talking at cross purposes when it comes to mapping techniques seems like a regular thing for teams. Using an experience map to understand how customers interact with your business is different from a story map, for example. I’m hoping this will tighten up my game, and help me use the right tools at the right time.

- [Agile Product Management with Scrum](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Agile-Product-Management-Scrum-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B003BW0C9I/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Agile+Product+Management+with+Scrum&qid=1610391190&s=digital-text&sr=1-1). Roman Pichler’s other book Stratgise was a fantastic read around some basic product management concepts to create alignment and direction. This focuses on the more granular practical application in a scrum environment. Worthwhile knowledge top up I hope.

- [User Story Mapping: Discover the Whole Story, Build the Right Product](https://www.amazon.co.uk/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product-ebook/dp/B00NF07FHS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=User+Story+Mapping_+Discover+the+Whole+Story%2C+Build+the+Right+Product&qid=1610391398&s=digital-text&sr=1-1). Jeff Patton is well known in the agile community, and I’ve never read this (embarrassingly). So, I’m going to read it. After going remote story maps fell out of favour for me, and that’s a shame. It’s time to kick off using them again.

- [Forever Employable How to Stop Looking for Work and Let Your Next Job Find You](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Forever-Employable-Stop-Looking-Work-ebook/dp/B086S5SJXM/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Forever+Employable+How+to+Stop+Looking+for+Work+and+Let+Your+Next+Job+Find+You&qid=1610391283&s=digital-text&sr=1-1). I’ve been meaning to read this for ages. Theres been a few occasions where I have felt my a-game is dipping, and I’m wondering if I am losing my edge. I’m hopeful reading this will help me regain some confidence, allow me to rethink a few things, and keep me sharp in the months ahead.

- I also just finished reading [What Do We Do Now?: A product manager's guide to strategy in the time of crisis](https://www.amazon.co.uk/What-Do-We-Now-managers-ebook/dp/B088VGN3XZ). Randy Silver is an amazing person to follow on Twitter, and has a knack for making things super easy to understand. Short, sweet, and essential read for times of turmoil. I recommend this one for only 4 pound!

And, that’s so far.

I’ll dig out some more in the coming months once I begin working through these. Ideas always welcome, ideally in the software architecture space!
