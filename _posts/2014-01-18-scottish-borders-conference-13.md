I was asked along to the Scottish Borders Tourism Partnership Conference at the tail end of the year. Whilst there I spent a bit of time talking about digital marketing, with the deck now being made available via VisitScotland.

There are plenty of talks available, so feel free to go check them out. You can grab mine below.
