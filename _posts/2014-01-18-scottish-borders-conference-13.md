title: Talk @ Scottish Borders tourism partnership conference 2013
---
I was kindly asked along to the Scottish Borders Tourism Partnership Conference at the tail end of 2013. Whilst there I spent a bit of time talking about digital marketing and some wider thoughts on digital in general. The deck has now been made available via [VisitScotland](http://www.visitscotland.com).

There are plenty of talks available, including my own, so feel free to go check them out. Them below.
