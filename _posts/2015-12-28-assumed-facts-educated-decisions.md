I love the [definition of data provided by Google](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=data%20definition):  

> Data, in philosophy, is “things known or assumed as facts, making the basis of reasoning or calculation.”

There’s something inherently beautiful about this definition. It establishes a relationship between assumed facts and their role in reasoning—ultimately enabling us to make educated decisions. 

[Reasoning](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=reasoning+definition), in turn, is defined as:  

> “The action of thinking about something in a logical, sensible way.”

We know that data is fundamental to effective [user-centered design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design). However, using the *wrong* data can sometimes be worse than having no data at all. Incorrect data can support flawed decisions and remain unnoticed for a long time. When we rely on flawed data to create solutions, we risk falling into a cycle of uneducated change—the exact opposite of what we aim to achieve through true iteration.  

> [Change](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=definition%20of%20change):  
> "An act or process through which something becomes different."

Whereas:  

> [Iteration](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=iteration+definition):  
> "The repetition of a process or utterance as a means of obtaining successively closer approximations to achieve a solution."

To truly improve, we need to iterate. And iteration only works when we use the right data at the right time. Our methods should provide data that fuels reasoning and informs decision-making—not lead us astray.  

## The Importance of Context in Data

Understanding and predicting user behavior is challenging even in the best of circumstances. This is why it's crucial to understand the available methods, what they provide, and how to converge data meaningfully.  

For example, pulling numbers from Google Analytics is meaningless without context. Context might come from additional sources, such as user interviews, or even understanding whether filters have been applied to the data. Beyond knowing *what* users are doing, context helps us uncover *why* they are doing it.

## Getting the Basics Right

Striking the right balance in research cadence is also essential. Stages like "research" and "measure" aren’t optional—though they can sometimes be treated as such. The key is adjusting their intensity to make them practical on a regular basis.  

Now more than ever, it’s critical to get the basics right:  

- Collecting the **right data**  
- At the **right time**  
- With the **right people** involved  

The goal is to present a series of assumed facts that enable us to make better-educated decisions.

## Final Thoughts

I have a feeling my phrase of the year for 2016 will be *assumed facts*—a reminder to base decisions on sound reasoning and reliable data.  

*Have a great New Year!*
