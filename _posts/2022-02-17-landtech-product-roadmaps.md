I wanted to pop together some thoughts on how LandTech have approached the product communities most divisive topic - product roadmaps.

**What were we aiming for?**

> Improve our current product roadmap so that everyone across the business could understand what problems we intend to solve for users, in what order, and indicate when customers *might* see these changes

**What wasn’t working with the current roadmap?**

We have made changes to our roadmap format during the last year that have been quite significant, and seen many changes made at once. Both these roadmaps saw feedback from viewers requesting, at times, conflicting changes.

We began by running a survey to understand what people liked and disliked about the current format.

What did we learn? People appeared to be finding the current roadmap confusing and unclear. We hadn’t struck the balance around what we were working on, vs. when people might expect to see these things available.

**How did we coordinate this?**

It was assumed that changing too much in one go would be confusing for everyone involved. Sometimes when you fix three things, you end up causing another three issues in unexpected ways - so we wanted to work from what we had.

We followed a little plan to make sure we had a complete picture.

1. Surveyed everyone across the business to understand likes / dislikes
2. Session with senior management on their needs
3. Made and had approved recommended changes
4. Consulted and collaborated with product managers on the changes
5. Updated the company, and produced guidance

**How does our product roadmap look now?**

- Organised using now / next / later so people know when things will begin
- Updated titles to reflect customer value
- Aligned to objectives
- Added consistent descriptions
- Statuses provided (new idea, candidate, discovery, delivery, shipped etc)
- Indicative release window (eg. Q4, or March 2022) on the card
- Linked to opportunity assessments (an assessment of the value of the idea)

Here is the internal product roadmap format...

**What about public product roadmaps?**

We’re keeping this one internal only, as the full breadth of information isn’t appropriate for making available externally.

However, we have now created an alternative for our customer community to consume. It’s going to be used to gather more direct feedback around our ideas.

- Organised using now available / in progress / considering (split into thinking about doing, and need more feedback on)
- Reduced information on each card, with now available / in progress including a sketch of the idea

Here is the public product roadmap format...

**What next?**

We’re going to monitor feedback from the teams about the changes, and see where we can make further improvements. And, we’re intending on rolling out the public product roadmap to our community in the near term - yeehaw.
