title: Revisiting an old favourite - URLs
---
When we embarked on our most recent public sector project, there was a big focus on shifting mindsets towards agile practices and away from traditional approaches to product and software development. I blogged briefly about this <a href="http://calumshep.com/agile-project-management/">personal switch to agile</a> back in February. 

So, where are we now? We are approaching our first alpha release, we have begun sharing some early thoughts over on <a href="http://inside.mygovscot.org">inside mygovscot</a>, we are on twitter and continue to code like crazy. 

As part of our hub and spoke model to content contribution within the team, I went back to an old favourite - URLs. 

<strong><a href="http://inside.mygovscot.org/2014/06/25/our-thoughts-on-urls/">Thoughts are over on the mygovscot blog</a> </strong>

(along with some other great contributions <a href="http://inside.mygovscot.org/2014/07/02/user-testing-in-alpha/">on areas such as user research</a>).
