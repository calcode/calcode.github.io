Thursday saw the annual occurrence of [Marketing Society Scotland’s Digital Day](https://www.marketingsociety.com/events-gallery/digital-day-scotland-2015) take place at Glasgow [Drygate](http://drygate.com/).

Arriving slightly late and a little flustered after morning meetings, I hadn’t quite had the chance to fully digest the agenda. 

What I found was a great line up of speakers with carefully chosen talks to cover a spread of topics. I would suspect that there was something for everyone who has an interest in digital, marketing or business. 

> Missed the event? Alan Barr, Digital Director of [The Big Partnership](http://www.bigpartnership.co.uk/) kindly made available his [Digital Day 2015 highlights](http://www.bigpartnership.co.uk/blog/digital-marketing/518-big-at-digitalday2015) over on their blog (thanks for the mention Alan!).

I was asked to join the afternoon panel to share my own experiences with digital. Here are my soundbites:

- digital hides a modern business strategy, it’s the convergence of things like marketing, communications, change and technology - don’t expect chief digital officers to be around in 10 years
- we have to accept we won’t always shape the experience for users. Content is being taken out of context and presented back to users through search engines and personal assistants. So, focus on structured data and help shape this
- there is a huge agenda for further digital participation, so hopefully we will see further prominence from older people in the digital space
- digital marketing teams have been born into the industry, so should remember that numbers represent people - get out there and find out who they are!

The opportunity to catch some fantastic talks was too good to pass up as well.

I’d like to thank Marketing Society Scotland for inviting me along - it was a pleasure.
