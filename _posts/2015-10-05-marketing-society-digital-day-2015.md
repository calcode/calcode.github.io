Thursday saw the annual occurrence of [Marketing Society Scotland’s Digital Day](https://www.marketingsociety.com/events-gallery/digital-day-scotland-2015) take place at Glasgow [Drygate](http://drygate.com/).

Arriving slightly late and a little flustered after morning meetings, I hadn’t quite had the chance to fully digest the agenda. 

What I found was a great line up of speakers with carefully chosen talks to cover a spread of topics. I would suspect that there was something for everyone who has an interest in digital, marketing or business. 

> Missed the event? Alan Barr, Digital Director of [The Big Partnership](http://www.bigpartnership.co.uk/) kindly made available his [highlights](http://www.bigpartnership.co.uk/blog/digital-marketing/518-big-at-digitalday2015) over on their blog (thanks for the mention Alan!).

I was pleased to be asked to join the afternoon session to share my own experiences. Here are the soundbites:

- **digital hides a modern business strategy**, it’s the convergence of things like marketing, communications, change and technology - don’t expect chief digital officers to be around in 10 years
- we have to accept **we won’t always be able to directly shape the experience for users**. Content is being taken out of context and presented back to users through search engines and personal assistants. So, focus on structured data and help shape this
- there is a huge **agenda for further digital participation**, so hopefully we will see further prominence from older people in the digital space
- people in digital marketing teams have often arrived directly into the digital space. So, it's important for them to remember that numbers represent people, so get out from behind the desk!

I was thankful to be able to catch some fantastic afternoon talks as well.

See you all next year.
