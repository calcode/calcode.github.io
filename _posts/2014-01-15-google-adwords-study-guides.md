Looking to expand your Adwords knowledge? Whether or not you actually manage Adwords campaigns, an understanding of how they work and paid media terminology in general is always going to be a benefit to you.

A lot of people will thus look to Google Exams to help with this, as they bundle revision with certification. To help with this, I've listed some Google Adwords Certification study guides that may aid in getting you through both the Fundamental and Advanced Search exams.

It is perfectly possible to pass your Google Adwords exam without the need for physical guides or online revision packages. However if you do need some additional reading or would like something for your desk, check this book - [Google AdWords For Dummies - Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1118115619/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1118115619&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=calsheblo-21).

Introducing Google Partners program - things have now changed.

- Google Partner Exams are now free! This means you don't need to pay for your Adwords exams anymore.
- The new Google Partners website is designed to allow you to revise and sit the exams, all via one portal.
- Resources from 3rd parties tend to be out of date and don't match the current Google Adwords Interface, nor the exam material. They do still provide value however and will no doubt be updated post launch of Google Partners.
- Google resources are at times a different from the interface, however you can bank on the Google material matching the exam.

In short, things are become a whole lot more clean when it comes to revision resources. Digging around for Google Adwords Certification study guides for your Fundamentals / Advanced Search exams is far less important post Google Partners launch.
