Looking to expand your Google Ads knowledge? Whether you manage Google Ads campaigns daily or are just getting started, a Google Ads Certification can help. The certification will improve your understanding of paid media terminology, how campaigns work, and provide a way for you to demonstrate your expertise to potential employers.

Many people turn to the Google Ads Certification for this purpose, as it includes study guides with the certification process. To help you prepare for your exams, I've compiled a list of Google Ads Certification study guides that will help you with both the Fundamentals and Advanced Search Advertising exams.

It’s possible to pass your Google Ads exam without physical guides or online revision packages. However, if you prefer additional help or something physical for your desk, the [Google AdWords For Dummies book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1118115619/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1118115619&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=calsheblo-21) is a great starting point. 

Where do you take the exam?

## Introducing the Google Partners program

- Google Partner Exams are now free! This means you no longer need to pay for your Ads exams
- The new Google Partners website is designed to allow you to revise and take exams all in one place
- Third-party resources can sometimes be outdated and may not reflect the current Google Ads interface or exam materials. However, they can still provide value and will likely be updated after the Google Partners launch
- Google’s own resources are the most reliable and will closely match the exam material

In short, revision resources have become much cleaner and more streamlined. After the Google Partners launch, searching for Google Ads Certification study guides for your Fundamentals / Advanced Search exams is far less critical.

##1. Official Google Study Guides

The Google Partners area provides all the initial steps to get you started. You’ll have access to seminars, study guides, and much more, which are essential for kicking off your Google Ads Certification study.

- Visit the [Google Partners help area](https://support.google.com/partners/topic/3204437?hl=en-GB&amp;ref_topic=3111012)
- Download the [Google Adwords Fundementals study guide (PDF)](https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3045820?hl=en-GB)
- Download the [Google Adwords Search Advanced study guide (PDF)](https://support.google.com/partners/answer/3045822?hl=en-GB)

##2. Google Adwords Help Centre

The Google Ads Help Centre is a valuable resource for terminology and a thorough walkthrough, from basic setup to billing. It’s more suited for referencing rather than direct exam study.

- Visit the [Google Adwords Help Centre](http://support.google.com/adwords/)

##3. Google Adwords Interface

The Google Ads interface is the best tool for getting hands-on experience and passing your exam. You’ll need a valid Google account with a name, address, and credit card (don’t worry, you can remove your card after setup).

The real value comes from assigning budgets and launching campaigns. Google regularly offers $50 vouchers to new users via email to help get campaigns started, so be on the lookout after activation. The Ads Coupon page is also helpful—currently offering £75 free with a £25 spend (confirmed as of Jan 2014).

##4. Google YouTube Adwords Playlist

Google’s YouTube channel offers various videos covering everything related to Google Ads. For a comprehensive overview, check out their introductory playlist.
