Looking to expand your Google Adwords knowledge? Whether you manage Google Adwords campaigns on a daily basis, or are just learning to learn, a Google Adwords Certification can help. The certification will help with your understanding of paid media terminology, how campaigns work provide a method for you to show potential employers what you can do. 

Thus, a lot of people look to the Google Adwords Certification to help with this, as they bundle study guides with certification. To help you with your exams, I've listed some Google Adwords Certification study guides that will help get you through both the Fundamental and Advanced Search Advertising exams.

It is possible to pass your Google Adwords exam without the need for physical guides or online revision packages. However if you do need additional help or would like something for your desk, this book is a great starting point - [Google AdWords For Dummies book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1118115619/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1118115619&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=calsheblo-21).

So, where do you sit the exam?

**Introducing the Google Partners program.**

- Google Partner Exams are now free! This means you don't need to pay for your Adwords exams anymore.
- The new Google Partners website is designed to allow you to revise and sit the exams, all via one portal.
- Resources from 3rd parties tend to be out of date and don't match the current Google Adwords Interface, nor the exam material. They do still provide value however and will no doubt be updated post launch of Google Partners.
- Google resources are at times a different from the interface, however you can bank on the Google material matching the exam.

In short, things are become a whole lot more clean when it comes to revision resources. Digging around for Google Adwords Certification study guides for your Fundamentals / Advanced Search exams is far less important post Google Partners launch.
