I was delighted to be asked by [DigitasLBi](http://www.digitaslbi.com/global/) to talk at "What's next in digital transformation". 

Given three busy weeks, I thought about what I could share that might be of value for others. So, I focused on our early process to ensure users are front and centre when producing information about public services.

This also provided me with a perfect opportunity to listen to some other interesting talks. These talks included emerging digital trends (Digitas LBi), organisational transformation and change (Standard Life), innovation in media (STV) and tips on optimising app store games to increase downloads (Channel 4).

The other talks were:

- John Monks, Head of Digital Business Design, DigitasLBi
- Mary Harper, Head of Customer and Digital Marketing, Standard Life
- David Milne, Head of Digital Publishing, STV
- Colin Macdonald, Commissioning Editor for Games, Channel 4

> There is also a summary of all the talks, including my own, available on the [Eden Scott blog](http://www.edenscott.com/blog/what%E2%80%99s-in-store-for-digital-in-2015) and I would suggest it is worth a look
