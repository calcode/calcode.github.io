I was delighted to be invited by [DigitasLBi](http://www.digitaslbi.com/global/) to speak at their event, *"What's Next in Digital"*  

With just three busy weeks to prepare, I reflected on what might provide the most value to others. My focus landed on our early approach to ensuring that **users are front and centre** when creating information about public services.

> **Putting users at the heart of your digital strategy**  
> A reflection on our early efforts and lessons learned.


## A Chance to Learn From Other Experts

The event also gave me the perfect opportunity to listen to fascinating talks from industry leaders. The topics covered included:

- **Emerging Digital Trends**  
  *By John Monks, Head of Digital Business Design, DigitasLBi*  
- **Organisational Transformation and Change**  
  *By Mary Harper, Head of Customer and Digital Marketing, Standard Life*  
- **Innovation in Media**  
  *By David Milne, Head of Digital Publishing, STV*  
- **Tips on Optimising App Store Games to Increase Downloads**  
  *By Colin Macdonald, Commissioning Editor for Games, Channel 4*

These presentations offered valuable insights across a variety of fields and sparked plenty of thought-provoking discussions.
