<strong>Working in an agile manner, after a history of creating bulky project briefs</strong> and requirements to front load work, is a little challenging to say the least. I had a history of attempting to nail long documentation, with the aim of ensuring outputs and outcomes would be realised. However, long development times, a lack of flexibility to change things and worries about launching early were always a common occurrence.

I'm now sketching out ideas on whitewalls, snapping photos, holding short stand ups and working with product owners who have a real passion for the projects under their guidance. We're aiming to release frequently and we're aiming to ensure that anything we do is backed by real, verified user needs - something that <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> have really been a champion for over the last few years (Thanks!).

<strong>It feels liberating. </strong>

If you are interested in finding out more, the web is awash with various flavours of agile project management methodologies. Within the division work with, we are making use of a hybrid approach, utilising <a href="http://www.dsdm.org/">DSDM</a> for more robust governance and fuller project documentation, alongside a more <a href="https://www.scrum.org/">Scrum </a>like methodology for the delivery teams.

Exciting times.
