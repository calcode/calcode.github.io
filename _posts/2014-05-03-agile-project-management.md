title: Agile Project Management in the Public Sector
---
Working in an agile manner, after a history of creating bulky project briefs and requirements to front load work, is a little challenging to say the least. I had a history of attempting to nail long documentation, with the aim of ensuring outputs and outcomes would be realised. However, long development times, a lack of flexibility to change things and worries about launching early were always a common occurrence.

I'm now sketching out ideas on whitewalls, snapping photos, holding short stand ups and working with product owners who have a real passion for the projects under their guidance. We're aiming to release frequently and we're aiming to ensure that anything we do is backed by real, verified user needs - something that [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/) have really been a champion for over the last few years (Thanks!).

It feels liberating.

If you are interested in finding out more, the web is awash with various flavours of agile project management methodologies. Within the division work with, we are making use of a hybrid approach, utilising [DSDM](http://www.dsdm.org/) for more robust governance and fuller project documentation, alongside a more [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) method for the delivery teams.

Exciting times.
