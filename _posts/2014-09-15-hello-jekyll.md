Goodbye [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/). It's been great working with you! Hello, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a static site generator and an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. To quote [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) you say? Sounds good to me. 

We're now up and running on GitHub, with Poole as our chosen template for Jekyll.

Migrating from WordPress is a breeze with some of the helpful apps available for this exact purpose. Interested? Check out this great post by [leon Paternoster](http://www.leonpaternoster.com/2013/06/moving-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) for a detailed guide.  

If you're less familiar with coding, there's a handy Windows app that does the job in a flash:[wpXml2Jekyll](https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll). You can grab it on GitHub.
