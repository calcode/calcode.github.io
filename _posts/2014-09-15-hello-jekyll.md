Goodbye [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/). It's been great working with you! Hello [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. To quote [the project's readme](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) you say? Sounds good to me. 

So, we're now up and running on GitHub, with Poole as the template of choice for Jekyll. 

Migrating from WordPress is a breeze when you make use of some of the useful apps out there for doing exactly that. Interested? There is a great post from [leon Paternoster](http://www.leonpaternoster.com/2013/06/moving-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) that explains all. 

However, if you are less code savvy - there is a great windows app that does it in a flash [wpXml2Jekyll](https://github.com/theaob/wpXml2Jekyll) - pick it up on GitHub.
