I had the pleasure of attending the <a href="http://festivalofmarketing.com/jump">Jump digital marketing event</a> in London yesterday, as part of the E-Consultancy <a href="http://festivalofmarketing.com/">Festival of Marketing</a>. Jump is all about creating a joined up consumer experience. Talks ranged from user experience to psychology and its impact on digital marketing, a real mix of extremely interesting and thought provoking topics.

<strong>Up close and personal, engaging your target audience anytime, anywhere</strong> - <a href="http://www.expedia.co.uk/"><strong>Expedia</strong></a>
<ul>
	<li>Made an early and accelerated move to mobile via an acquisition. The team worked relatively independently of the main organisation in a separate physical location (San Francisco). The result? They moved quickly and freely in many instances from their central head office in Seattle - driving forward their mobile offering in a relatively short period of team.</li>
	<li>Expedia identified early on that responsive design wasn't the best choice or their objectives, as they felt the ability to create unique experiences for difference screensizes / and usage enviroments trumped all other considerations.</li>
	<li>Positioning mobile prominently was important for them, integrating it in with internal KPIs and offering unique deals to consumers.</li>
	<li>TV campaigns are built around their mobile offering, with dedicated ads produced to highlight unique functionality and features.</li>
	<li>Optimisation does not live on traditional search channels anymore. A focus needs to be paid to presentation within mobile app stores. This includes icons, descriptions, reviews and driving downloads.</li>
</ul>

<strong>More channels, more opportunities, delivering personalised service in a digital world</strong> -<strong> <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/uk/">American Express</a></strong>
<ul>
	<li>Some huge partnerships for American Express over the last couple of years. A fascinating take away from the Facebook partnership; the majority of card holders who synced their details with Facebook had actually opted out of email communication from the organisation.</li>
	<li>Their newest TripAdvisor partnership involves checking payment histories to confirm reviews are by people who have actually stayed at the venue - extremely interesting review trust indicator.</li>
	<li>Others partnerships included Xbox Live (Game progress / rewards) and Twitter (Tweet to buy, Tweet for discount).</li>
	<li>Cultural change within the organisation a big focus, with importance placed upon people using the digital platforms the organisation is trying to drive forward. Others important areas included revisiting internal guidelines, throwing away job titles for brainstorming, simplifying processes and encouraging a start up ethos operating under the company philosophy.</li>

	<li>Statistics galore from this white paper overview. Due to the amount of statistics and the presentation being publicly available in the near future, I'll refrain from sharing specific stats, but will however hopefully update this post with a link once available.</li>
	<li>Most common (and important) testing is A/B - with the least common (but still important) being personalisation. Specific tests within A/B that proved to be quick wins included modifying CTA buttons and descriptive text.</li>
	<li>A critical consideration for organisations planning to kick start testing in this area is to define testing roles and to prioritise.</li>
	<li>Need justification for carrying out UX experiments? Get someone in front of a camera and give them some key tasks to perform on your website. It may well be the best justification you will ever have for senior management to take note and listen.</li>

<strong>Using social media to engagement customers and maximise promotions ....</strong> - <a href="http://www.yosushi.com/"><strong>Yo Sushi</strong></a>
<ul>
	<li>An interesting presentation from a brand keen to be presented as fun and vibrant - focusing on buzz building as the primary mechanic.</li>
	<li>Customer service is a critical part of their social presence, resolving complaints on the channel of the customers choice, in turn seeing some great online feedback.</li>
	<li>Using social as a source of insights about their customers, collecting and passing on feedback for various areas of the business to improve the way they operate. This included things like new store opening.</li>
	<li>An engaging campaign involved visiting offices with Sushi at the request of workers - in costume and with plenty of food!</li>
</ul>
The above is a tiny account of the event, as Jump spanned the entire day (with the Festival of Marketing on all week). To wrap up, I thought I would include a video from the final psychology session, describing "social proof".
