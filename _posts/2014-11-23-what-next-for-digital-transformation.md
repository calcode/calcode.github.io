I was delighted to be asked by [DigitasLBi](http://www.digitaslbi.com/global/) to present on digital transformation within Scottish Government. 

Given three busy weeks, I quickly put together some slides about the efforts to create a passionate digital team in Government. A team is tasked with helping organisations transform the way public services are delivered in Scotland.

> Talk: The needs of users, their journeys and transforming public services

This dual served as the perfect opportunity to listen to some great speakers. Topics included digital trends (Digitas LBi), organisational transformation and change (Standard Life), innovation in media (STV) and tips on optimising app store games for maximum downloads (Channel 4).

Speakers included:

- John Monks, Head of Digital Business Design, DigitasLBi
- Mary Harper, Head of Customer and Digital Marketing, Standard Life
- David Milne, Head of Digital Publishing, STV
- Colin Macdonald, Commissioning Editor for Games, Channel 4

Given three busy weeks, I rushed together a couple of slides about our efforts over the last eight months to introduce a passionate digital team to Government. This team, as a collective, tasked with helping organisations transform the way public services are delivered in Scotland.
