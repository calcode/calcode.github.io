Some good news! Although a little late in highlighting, the digital team at VisitScotland were shortlisted for an [E-Consultancy #TheDigitals Travel and Tourism](http://thedigitalsawards.com/) award, back in May 2013.

Our campaign, which revolved around Shetland ponies in cardigans, was a collaborative effort that saw strong work from our PR team and impressive content production. The results were excellent: high-quality search rankings for related terms, TV features in the US, and ongoing engagement on social media. Even now, we continue to see a steady stream of traffic to our blog post about the ponies. It remains the most successful single page we’ve ever published on our .com site.

The Shetland ponies were a fresh, creative idea and a perfect example of cross-team collaboration.

Here’s the US TV spot from CNN:

Although we didn’t win that night, it was still a fantastic outcome for the team and the company.
