Unless your settings are a little off and you are currently making use of Google.com, then this change will have passed you by. 

When you do a Google search on Google.com for health related queries, you will likely be presented a unique knowledge graph result right there on the page. 

[Search for breast cancer on Google.com](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1318&bih=699&q=Breast+cancer&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAGOovnz8BQMDgxiHqBCHfq6-QWFykYESmJVlkZEid89yUVS459banolPNkw1fGEiwfMOAOvwXWszAAAA)

Giving you information on symptoms, treatments and commonality - it really is everything you would expect from a quick introduction to a condition.

The mobile design sees the information presented above the results, whereas tablet / desktop is on the right. 

Where does this come from? Surely it cannot be a pure algorithmic approach to discovering, understanding and presenting information on health back to users?

> We use a combination of algorithms and medical professionals to create this medical information. First, our algorithms find and analyze health-related information from high-quality sites across the web. Then, teams of doctors carefully review and refine the information and licensed medical illustrators create the visuals.

Interesting. Depending upon whether you are in the public or private sector, your view on this might differ massively.
