It’s time to break the blogging drought with a hands-on post.

For a recent product launch, our team chose to use mind mapping to create the information architecture (IA), rather than following the more conventional site-tree approach.

> "Information architecture is the practice of deciding how to arrange the parts of something to be understandable." — IA Institute

We decided to use software to facilitate the process. Ideally, we would have collaborated in a physical space, but since that wasn’t an option, we went with what we felt was the next best solution.

[MindNode 2](https://mindnode.com/mindnode/mac), a user-friendly application available on the Mac App Store, became our primary tool for visualising our initial ideas. It allowed us to collaborate effectively within the team and share our progress with stakeholders and users.

With MindNode, you can easily add nodes as new information or topics emerge from sources such as user research, search demand, conversations with stakeholders, or insights from subject matter experts.

## Diagram Tips

Here are some tips for creating effective IA diagrams with MindNode:

- **Line Colours**: Use different colours to separate topics or highlight different audiences.
- **Line Weightings**: Adjust line thickness to indicate the volume or complexity of the information.
- **Arrows**: Use arrows to show relationships between nodes or highlight critical cross-linking.
- **Node Types**: Represent the type of content (e.g., video, image, text) with specific node styles.
- **Notes**: Add explanations to indicate where the information came from, such as user research findings.

You can also create a couple of main nodes to act as a legend, providing a clear reference for others viewing the diagram.

MindNode is flexible enough to accommodate changes. If you need to move or reorganise elements, the nodes will dynamically adjust and resize. It’s intentionally vague enough to avoid being mistaken for a final deliverable, while still being clear and collaborative.
