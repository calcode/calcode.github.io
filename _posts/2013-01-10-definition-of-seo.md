Digital moves quickly. This time of year frequently sees a wealth of blog and industry news focused on one aspect of this, SEO. Camps tend to joust for attention and kudos, producing link bait focused articles which aim to foretell the future. Posts are either plain misguided, or quite notable pieces that are worthy of the coverage they receive. Unfortunately on many occasions its the first of the two that is true, with said articles being poorly promoted with overly optimised headings and content.

Some commentary on the subject and pieces in question;
<ul>
	<li><strong>The definition of SEO depends upon the individual</strong>, with algorithm changes and thought leaders driving definitions</li>
	<li><strong>SEO has evolved</strong> from a "one man know it all show" to something which requires delegation of key aspects to multiple teams - both technical and business oriented</li>
	<li>The <strong>SEO industry has grown its marketing legs</strong>, with a lot of traditional gurus from technical backgrounds now competing for roles with traditional marketers who have adapted to digital (alongside digital fresh faces)</li>
	<li><strong>The organisation defines the role</strong> in many instances. A small company can see an SEO manager take on multiple roles including content production. In a large organisation coordination becomes far more important, with the role being one of synergy across teams</li>
	<li>The breadth of modern, sustainable SEO has seen a lot of <strong>people come and go from the industry</strong> - of whom the vast majority will all end up working in a role that they encompassed to some extent during their time in SEO (Project Management, UX, Content Marketing etc)</li>
	<li>Many <strong>SEOs attempt to redefine their role</strong>. The truth is, no matter how you describe your current position - true SEO now encompasses a lot of the unpaid digital spectrum - thus is something to be extremely proud of</li>
</ul>
The industry has changed, the definition has changed and the people have changed - its a form of natural evolution. No matter whether your strengths are routed in technical understanding or marketing prowess, you can still excel as both are still vastly important.
<blockquote>"If SEO is dead, then so is TV. Definitions change and much like TV isn't just about Mad Men era adverts anymore (just look at product placement), SEO isn't just about its traditional roots. The only difference is adverts didn't die, meta keywords did"</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">What doesn't die is an evolving strategy, it adapts and innovations - that's pretty much what SEO should be defined as. A modern digital strategy which encompasses many digital marketing elements. It is an exciting time.</p>
