I am now full time with GeckoEngage as their VP of Product. GeckoEngage are a small EdTech startup rethinking how students communicate with education institutions -  events, forms, messaging and chatbots.

I'm still available for speaking, can give advice, or nudge you in the right direction wherever I can - just get in touch.
