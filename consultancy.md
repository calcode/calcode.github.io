Hi! I'm a Product Lead dedicated to building data-driven B2B and SaaS products made possible by AI . Throughout my career, I've specialised in transforming complex, fragmented data into award-winning, actionable insights that drive measurable business value. I use deep discovery techniques to unearth what users actually need, then ship high-impact features that solve those problems.

With a background spanning PropTech, FinTech, and the Public Sector, I combine diverse industry experience with a passion for beautiful user experiences. My focus is simple: cutting through complexity to deliver the right solutions for customers.
