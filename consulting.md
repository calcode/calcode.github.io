I'm open to new opportunities, both freelance (eg. temporary work, contract opportunities), and permanent employment with the right company.

I'm happy working with a single team as a product manager, or setting the direction for multiple teams and working with product managers to ensure the right outcomes are hit.

I have experience with agile, scrum, teams at various levels of maturity, various technology stacks, and have spent time in financial services, eduction technology, and public sector.
